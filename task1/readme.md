# 📘 README – Task 1

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Credit Delinquency

### 📌 Objective

The goal of Task 1 was to understand Geldium’s customer dataset and identify patterns related to credit delinquency. This analysis laid the foundation for building a predictive model and business recommendations in later tasks.

### 🔍 Key Activities

* Reviewed dataset structure and data definitions
* Assessed data quality (missing values, distributions, consistency)
* Explored relationships between customer attributes and delinquency behavior
* Used GenAI tools to support insight generation and summarization

### 📊 Key Insights

* Customers with **higher credit utilization** showed a greater likelihood of delinquency
* **Repeated missed or late payments** strongly correlated with default risk
* **Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio** emerged as a major financial stress indicator
* Lower income and shorter account tenure were associated with increased risk

### 🎯 Outcome

The EDA helped identify the most influential risk drivers and informed feature selection for the predictive modeling framework used in Task 2.
