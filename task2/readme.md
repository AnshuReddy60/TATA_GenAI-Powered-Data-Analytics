# 📘 README – Task 2

## Predictive Model Planning Using GenAI

### 📌 Objective

Task 2 focused on designing a **conceptual predictive model** to forecast customer delinquency. The task emphasized model logic, justification, and evaluation planning rather than coding.

### 🧠 Model Approach

* **Model Type Selected:** Logistic Regression
* **Problem Type:** Binary classification (Delinquent vs. Non-Delinquent)

### 🔧 Model Logic (High Level)

1. Ingest customer demographic, financial, and behavioral data
2. Preprocess and encode variables
3. Engineer behavioral risk features (e.g., missed payments over time)
4. Generate a delinquency probability score
5. Classify customers based on risk thresholds

### ✅ Justification for Model Choice

* High interpretability (critical for financial services)
* Transparent decision-making for regulatory compliance
* Efficient, scalable, and widely accepted in credit risk modeling

### 📈 Evaluation Strategy

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC
* Bias and fairness checks across demographic segments
* Ethical review of feature usage and decision impact

### 🎯 Outcome

Delivered a clear, explainable predictive framework aligned with Geldium’s business and regulatory requirements.
